/// This class is intended to be used as the `BridgeClient` app singleton. It manages login, app state,
/// app configuration, user configuration, notifications, and uploading files to Bridge services. It is intended
/// to be used in conjunction with a `UIApplicationDelegate` to handle start up and background
/// uploading.
///
/// At a minimum, the app must implement the following methods in the app delegate:
/// ```
/// class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
///     let bridgeManager = BridgeClientAppManager(appId: PrivateKeys.shared.appId, pemPath: PrivateKeys.shared.pemPath)
///
///     func application(_ application: UIApplication, willFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]?) -> Bool {
///         bridgeManager.appWillFinishLaunching(launchOptions)
///         return super.application(application, willFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
///     }
///
///     func application(_ application: UIApplication, handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession identifier: String,
///        completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
///         bridgeManager.handleEvents(for: identifier, completionHandler: completionHandler)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - SeeAlso: ``SingleStudyAppManager`` which subclasses ``BridgeClientAppManager``
///             to support features of a single study sign-in that is required to get a timeline for the participant.
///

    /// process observed changes on a background thread so the Kotlin classes must be wrapped. This
    /// state enum is used to allow the app content view to change the UI to match the login state.
    ///
    /// - Example:
    /// ```
